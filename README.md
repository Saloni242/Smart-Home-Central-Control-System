# Smart-Home-Central-Control-System
Smart Home Central Control System is a web-application, integrated with IOT for home automation. This system contains two major nodes i.e. Service provider and Subscriber. It aims to provide the subscribers with affordable home automation which can be controlled wirelessly by choosing different plans which contain a limited number of devices to be automated along with expiration period.
The service provider has various functionalities like adding new subscribers, updating the records of existing subscribers and viewing the records of its associated subscribers. Furthermore, service providers can revoke the access of subscribers if they fail to pay the subscription fee for the automation system.  The system also adheres to the safety measures by incorporating high-temperature checks during the device access by the user and admin. In sum, the whole project provides a user friendly web application that contains all the above mentioned functionalities on a PHP based platform integrated with IOT.
